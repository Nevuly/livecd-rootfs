# Generation of the model:
# * At https://github.com/canonical/models one can find a repo of raw,
#   unsigned, input .json files, and their signed .model equivalents.
# * At least once per cycle, update the json for the new Ubuntu version.
#   To do this, take the previous cycle ubuntu-classic-$ver-amd64.json file,
#   rename for the new version, and do any necessary updates including fixing
#   the versions of tracks.
# * When this is done, the json needs to be signed.  This needs to be done by
#   a Canonical employee - try asking someone who has recently opened PRs on
#   https://github.com/canonical/models with the signed models.
# * Ensure the signed and unsigned version of the models are updated in the
#   models repo.
# * The signed model can then be placed here in livecd-rootfs at
#   live-build/${PROJECT}/ubuntu-classic-amd64.model
